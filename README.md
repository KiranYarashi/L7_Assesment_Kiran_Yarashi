## SQL Queries and ORM Abstraction
The application uses raw SQL queries for database operations. Here are some examples:


- **Add Flavour**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO flavours(name, description, is_seasonal, season) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)
  ```

- **Get All Flavours**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM flavours
  ```

- **Delete Flavour**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM flavours WHERE id = ?
  ```

- **Add Ingredient**:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO ingredients(name, quantity, unit, allergen_info) VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)
  ```

- **Get All Ingredients**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM ingredients
  ```

- **Delete Ingredient**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM ingredients WHERE id = ?
  ```
